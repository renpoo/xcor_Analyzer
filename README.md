# xcor_Analyzer
## -- Microscope for Sound and Music --

This xcor_Analyzer is based on an idea of Prof. K. ITO (Univ. of Tokyo), and implemented by me under his request.
"xcor" is stand for "Cross-Correlation Function", which is one-more-degree expansion of (well-known) "Correlation Coefficient" in Statistics.

Let us see the power of this xcor_Analyzer by examples.

First of all, here is a sample sound file.
Let us listen to the voice.

This voice is mine, saying "Too Bad!", and recorded by the "binaural" stereo microphone like below.
