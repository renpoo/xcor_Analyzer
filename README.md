# xcor_Analyzer
## -- Microscope for Sound and Music --

This xcor_Analyzer is based on an idea of Prof. K. ITO (Univ. of Tokyo), and implemented by me under his request.

"xcor" is stand for "Cross-Correlation Function", which is one-more-degree expansion of (well-known) "Correlation Coefficient" in Statistics.

Let us see the power of this xcor_Analyzer by examples.

First of all, here is a sample sound file.

Let us listen to the voice.

This voice is mine, saying "Too Bad!", and recorded by the "binaural" stereo microphone like below.

Analyzing this "Too Bad!" by xcor_Analyzer, we can see the resulting image like this.
